    <h1>Understanding Agricultural Practices</h1>

    <!-- Strong and Bold Text -->
    <p><strong>Sustainable agriculture</strong> is essential for maintaining <b>ecological balance</b>.
        It ensures long-term productivity of farmland while conserving natural resources.
        Sustainable farming techniques help prevent soil erosion and degradation.
        By using organic fertilizers, farmers reduce dependency on chemical inputs.
        Crop diversification minimizes the risks associated with monoculture farming.
        It also enhances biodiversity, which supports natural pest control.
        Overall, sustainable agriculture promotes food security and environmental health.</p>

    <!-- Emphasize and Italic Text -->
    <p><em>Conservation tillage</em> helps in reducing soil erosion and maintaining soil health.
        This method minimizes soil disturbance, allowing organic matter to accumulate.
        By retaining crop residues on the field, it improves moisture retention.
        Conservation tillage reduces labor and fuel costs for farmers.
        It enhances soil structure, reducing the risk of compaction.
        Farmers practicing this method contribute to carbon sequestration.
        Ultimately, it plays a vital role in sustainable land management.</p>

    <!-- Idiomatic Text -->
    <p>The concept of <i>crop rotation</i> is vital for soil health and agricultural sustainability.
        By alternating different crops, farmers prevent nutrient depletion in the soil.
        Leguminous plants, when included in rotation, help fix nitrogen naturally.
        This practice disrupts pest and disease cycles, reducing pesticide use.
        Crop rotation also improves soil fertility, leading to higher yields.
        It enhances organic matter content and promotes beneficial microorganisms.
        Adopting this method ensures long-term agricultural productivity.</p>

    <!-- Superscript and Subscript -->
    <p>The chemical formula for photosynthesis is 6CO<sub>2</sub> + 6H<sub>2</sub>O →
        C<sub>6</sub>H<sub>12</sub>O<sub>6</sub> + 6O<sub>2</sub>.
        This process occurs in the chloroplasts of plant cells.
        Sunlight provides the necessary energy to drive this reaction.
        Carbon dioxide is absorbed from the atmosphere through stomata.
        Water is taken up by roots and transported to the leaves.
        Glucose produced during photosynthesis serves as plant food.
        Oxygen is released into the air, supporting life on Earth.</p>

    <p>The <sup>15th</sup> century marked significant advancements in agriculture and farming techniques.
        During this period, new irrigation methods improved crop production.
        Farmers began adopting better plowing and planting techniques.
        Domestication of animals for labor increased farming efficiency.
        Trade expansion led to the exchange of agricultural knowledge.
        New crops were introduced to different regions, boosting food diversity.
        The innovations of this time laid the foundation for modern agriculture.</p>
