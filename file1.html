    <h2>The Importance of Agriculture</h2>
    <p>A key to why agriculture is important to business and society is its output — from producing raw materials to
        contributing to the global supply chain and economic development. </p>

    <p> Providing Raw Materials: Raw materials are a core building block of the global economy. Without access to raw
        materials, manufacturers can’t make products. Nonagricultural raw materials include steel, minerals, and coal.
        However, many raw materials derive from agriculture — from lumber for construction materials to herbs for adding
        flavor to food. Corn, for example, is used to produce foods and serves as a foundation for ethanol, a type of
        fuel. Another example is resinsExternal link:open_in_new: plant products used in various industrial
        applications, such as adhesives, coatings, and paintsExternal link:open_in_new used in construction.
    </p>

    <p> Creating a Strong Supply Chain: Importing and exporting goods such as agricultural products requires shipping
        methods such as ocean freight, rail, and trucking. Delays in shipping agricultural products from a Los Angeles
        port can create problems in China, and vice versa, impacting the global supply chain.
        For example, sales of soybean crops from IowaExternal link:open_in_new skyrocketed in 2021 due to various
        factors including delays in South American crop shipments, according to the Iowa Soybean Association. In this
        example, Iowa benefited from a competitive standpoint. However, delays in shipping crops could also be
        detrimental to regions expecting shipment, limiting availability of products on store shelves and affecting
        livelihoods.
    </p>

    <p>Encouraging Economic Development
        Agriculture impacts global trade because it’s tied to other sectors of the economy, supporting job creation and
        encouraging economic development. Countries with strong agricultural sectors experience employment growth in
        other sectors, according to USAID. Countries with agricultural productivity growth and robust agriculture
        infrastructure also have higher per capita incomes, since producers in these countries innovate through
        technology and farm management practices to boost agricultural productivity and profitability.
    </p>

    <h3>Historical Background</h3>
    <p>Agriculture dates back over 10,000 years to the Neolithic era when early humans transitioned from hunting and
        gathering to cultivating crops and domesticating animals, leading to the formation of settled societies. The
        first agricultural practices emerged in regions like Mesopotamia, Egypt, India, and China, where fertile lands
        supported crop cultivation. Over centuries, innovations such as irrigation, plowing, crop rotation, and
        selective breeding enhanced productivity. The Agricultural Revolution in the 18th and 19th centuries introduced
        mechanization, fertilizers, and improved techniques, significantly increasing food production. Today, modern
        agriculture integrates technology, genetic engineering, and sustainable practices to meet the demands of a
        growing global population while addressing environmental challenges.</p>

    <h4>Modern Agricultural Practices</h4>
    <p>Today, agriculture incorporates advanced technologies to increase efficiency and sustainability.</p>

    <h5>Challenges in Agriculture</h5>
    <p> Farmers must meet the changing needs of our planet and the expectations of regulators, consumers, and food
        processors and retailers.
    </p>
    <p>
        There are increasing pressures from climate change, soil erosion and biodiversity loss and from consumers’
        changing tastes in food and concerns about how it is produced. And the natural world that farming works with –
        plants, pests and diseases – continue to pose their own challenges.
    </p>
    <p>
        While modern agriculture provides a large number of solutions, the outcome is not always the same because each
        farm is unique: different landscapes, soils, available technology and potential yields.
    </p>

    <h6>Future of Agriculture</h6>
    <p>Future agriculture will use sophisticated technologies such as robots, temperature and moisture sensors, aerial
        images, and GPS technology. These advanced devices and precision agriculture and robotic systems will allow
        farms to be more profitable, efficient, safe, and environmentally friendly.</p>
    <p>Mechanisation, combined with smart farming technologies, offers a path forward, and by 2029, India's agricultural
        landscape could undergo a revolution akin to the Green Revolution of the 1960s.
        Smart farming – using data-driven insights to optimise agricultural operations at a micro level – would play a
        crucial role.</p>
